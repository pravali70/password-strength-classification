# 🔐 Password Strength Classification - Mini Project
👋 Hello and welcome to this insightful mini-project on Password Strength Classification!

## 📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on cybersecurity and password safety, using a real-world dataset containing:

password: A string representing the user’s password

strength: A label indicating the password’s strength:

0 → Weak

1 → Medium

2 → Strong

Our goal is to build a machine learning pipeline—from data preprocessing and feature extraction to model training and evaluation—to automatically classify the strength of a password based on its characteristics.

## 🎯 Objective
The primary objective is to build and compare various classification models to accurately predict the strength of a given password.

This classification supports:

Promoting strong password usage

Enhancing cybersecurity awareness

Developing password evaluation tools and security assistants

Models Evaluated:
Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Decision Tree

Random Forest

AdaBoost

XGBoost

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
We evaluate each model using the following performance metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

These metrics help us assess how well each model differentiates between weak, medium, and strong passwords.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
This project is developed in Python using the following tools:

pandas – Data handling and preprocessing

numpy – Numerical computations

scikit-learn – Machine learning models and evaluation

xgboost – Advanced boosting model

matplotlib & seaborn – Visualization and EDA

nltk / re – For text preprocessing and pattern extraction

## ✅ Outcome
By evaluating and comparing the models, we identify the most effective algorithm for predicting password strength.

Key takeaways include:

Insights into what makes a password strong or weak

Tools for building smarter password validation systems

Better user education on password security

Foundations for developing real-time password-strength checkers

💡 Thanks for exploring this project! We hope it helps you understand the role of machine learning in improving online security and safe password practices.
